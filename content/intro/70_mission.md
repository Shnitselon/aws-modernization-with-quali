* You are a DevOps engineer at Gourmet Inc. and you just found out that the DevOps engineer responsible for launching the company's new shopping cart app just left the company. To make matters worse, this person has left you zero documentation and apparently hasn’t configured anything that can be reused for the deployment. You know that if you had time you would stand up a Jenkins server, set up dev/test/prod, get a pipeline going, enable testing, etc —. but you don’t have time.

* You have heard through a DevOps colleague that Quali can help you get everything you need in a fraction of the time it would take, so you decide to take Quali for a test spin and see how it stacks up.

* Gourmet Inc. management wants your approach to (1) beapplicable to other applications within the company in the future, and (2) be PCI-compliant for credit card payments.
