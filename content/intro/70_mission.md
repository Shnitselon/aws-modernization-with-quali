* You are a DevOps engineer at Gourmet Inc. who just finds out that the DevOps engineer responsible for launching the company's new shopping cart app has just left the company. To make matters worse, this person has left you zero documentation and apparently hasn’t configured anything that can be reused for the deployment. Ideally, you would stand up a Jenkins server, set up dev/test/prod, get a pipeline going, enable testing, etc —. but you don’t have the time.

* You have heard through a DevOps colleague that Quali can help you get everything you need in a fraction of the time it would take, so you decide to take Quali for a test spin and see how it stacks up.

* Gourmet Inc. management wants your approach to be (1) PCI-compliant for credit card payments and (2) applicable to other applications within the company in the future.
